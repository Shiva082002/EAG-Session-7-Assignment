    "chunk": "DLF Limited (formerly Delhi Land & Finance) is an Indian commercial real estate development company. It was founded by Chaudhary Raghvendra Singh in 1946, and it is based in New Delhi, India.[2][3] DLF has developed residential colonies in Delhi such as Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Krishna Nagar, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony, and Hauz Khas. DLF builds residential, office, and retail properties.[4][5] With the passage of the Delhi Development Act in 1957, the local government assumed control of real estate development and banned private real estate developers from Delhi proper. As a result, DLF began acquiring land at a relatively low cost outside the area controlled by the Delhi Development Authority, in the district of Gurgaon, and in the adjacent state of Haryana. In the mid-1970s, the company started developing their DLF City project at Gurgaon. This included hotels, infrastructure, and special economic zones-related development projects. The company is headed by Rajiv Singh, who is the current chairman of the DLF Group. According to the Forbes listing of richest billionaires in 2023, Kushal Pal Singh, Chairman Emeritus, is the 19th richest man in India with a net worth of US$8.8 billion. The company's $US$2 billion IPO in July 2007 was India's biggest IPO in history.[6] In its first quarter results for the period ending 30 June 2007, the company reported a turnover of \u20b931.2098 billion (US$360 million) and profit after taxes of \u20b915.1548 billion (US$180 million).[7] As of 31 March 2012, the company had 1,380 square feet of leased retail space across the country.[8] In",

Subsequently, the company developed 21 colonies in Delhi, including Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Punjabi Bagh, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony and Hauz Khas. The passage of Delhi Development Act in 1957 was the first serious challenge to company's growth. The Act meant that the government would assume control of all real estate development activities in the city.[11] As a result, DLF decided to move beyond Delhi and focused on the suburb of Gurgaon in Haryana,[12] which had the potential for development of residential and commercial properties. As DLF started to acquire land under the leadership of Chairman K.P. Singh, Gurgaon embarked on a period of rapid growth.[13] A \u20b958 crore deal was cancelled between DLF and Robert Vadra by IAS officer Ashok Khemka.[14] Sponsorship In 2008, DLF became the title sponsor of the Indian Premier League, a newly formed Twenty20 cricket league. DLF paid close to \u20b92 billion (US$23 million) for the five-year sponsorship deal.[15] The deal ended in the 2012 version of the season, wherein it was taken over by Pepsi.

Beyond buildings Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA) and DLF, in a 50:50 joint venture, have completed work on a 16-lane, 10.5 km road network in Gurgaon. This stretch from NH8 Toll Plaza to Sector 55/56 in Gurgaon with six underpasses, one flyover and freeways has improved traffic management in the city.[16] To create this infrastructure facility, DLF had engaged Parsons Brinckerhoff for project management consultancy and construction work had been awarded to IL&FS.[17] Controversies In August 2011, a penalty of \u20b96.3 billion (US$74 million) was imposed on DLF by the Competition Commission of India (CCI)[18] after finding DLF guilty of breaching laws regarding the unfair pricing of goods and services. The complaint was lodged against DLF by buyers in its residential projects Belaire & Park Place, located in Gurgaon.[19] In February 2015, the CCI ordered its investigative arm to probe two more projects of DLF in Gurgaon, namely, DLF Regal Gardens[20] and DLF Skycourt.[21][22] DLF land grab case pertains to the alleged illegal acquisition of 50 acres of land in Amipur village, Haryana, back in 2013, during Bhupinder Singh Hooda's tenure as Chief Minister under the Congress government. This matter has led to an investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation involving Robert Vadra, Bhupinder Singh Hooda, and the DLF, as of around December 2017.[23]",

In its annual report for 2012, the company summarizes its business operations: We design, develop, manufacture and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles and advanced electric vehicle powertrain components. We own our sales and service network and have operationally structured our business in a manner that we believe will enable us to rapidly develop and launch advanced electric vehicles and technologies. We believe our vehicles, electric vehicle engineering expertise, and operational structure differentiates us from incumbent automobile manufacturers. We are the first company to commercially produce a federally-compliant electric vehicle, the Tesla Roadster, which achieves a market-leading range on a single charge combined with attractive design, driving performance and zero tailpipe emissions. As of December 31, 2012, we had delivered approximately 2,450 Tesla Roadsters to customers in over 30 countries. While we have concluded the production run of the Tesla Roadster, its proprietary electric vehicle powertrain system is the foundation of our business. We modified this system for our Model S sedan and plan to continue to enhance it for use in our future electric vehicles, including our Model X crossover. 1 The company notes that \u2018the commercial production of a highway capable, fully electric vehicle that",

(Sorry, patent-assertion-entity business). But what if Tesla sold its patents or went bankrupt. Could a third party not enforce the patents? If it could, patents promised to be open source would seem a rich market for PAEs. Tesla is not to first to pledge its patents as open source.

Lawrence Lessig helped set up the Creative Commons in order to facilitate accessible licensing across a wide range of copyright works.73 Open source strategies have also been adopted in other fields of endeavour. There has been open source tactics deployed in respect of plant breeding and agriculture.

He has also emphasized the combination of big data and fast product development: The difference between the value of Tesla\u2019s electric miles and GM\u2019s gasoline miles has to do with data. Think of an electric vehicle as a mobile computer. Electric Vehicles generate vast amounts of data. A car company sifting through this data can learn and adapt far more quickly than a company without user data. A car company that collects data about its cars can understand customer usage patterns and technology stresses and failures. It can quickly fix mistakes, download new software to the cars, and develop new products and services. The electric vehicle product development process is shortened; it resembles the computer industry\u2019s ultra-fast development cycles.

The increased demand from solar and wind increases the scale of existing Li-on providers, which in turn pushes down the cost of electric vehicles, solar, and wind. The increasing demand for electric vehicles and solar will attract even more investment in these technologies. Innovative companies that can invent new ways to push costs down and push quality up will thrive. This virtuous cycle of increasing demand, increasing investment, and increasing innovation will dramatically lower costs; it will exponentially improve the quality benefits to both the clean energy and clean transportation industries; it will also lead to a convergence in which batteries can be used for transportation and grid storage. Electric vehicles can be charged at work and become a source as well as a user of energy for the home. The result will be a swift transition from liquid-energy transportation to electric transportation.109 Seba admits that \u2018an electric vehicle is still more expensive to purchase upfront, mainly due to battery costs\u2019.110 He predicts that \u2018like other technology products, the technology cost curve of electric vehicles points to a disruption soon; innovative business models will only accelerate the transition from gasoline to electric vehicles.\u2019111 It is certainly notable that Elon Musk has investments in both electric cars and solar energy.

In its annual report, Tesla Motors highlights the role of marketing in respect of electric cars. The company notes: \u2018As the first company to commercially produce a federally-compliant, fully electric vehicle that achieves market-leading range on a single charge, we have been able to generate significant media coverage of our company and our vehicles, and we believe we will continue to do so\u2019.144 Tesla Motors has certainly excelled at marketing and branding clean technology (which has sometimes been rather dour by comparison to other sectors). Elon Musk has certainly shown a Steve Jobs-like elan and bravura at salesmanship and promotion. The company Tesla Motors has also been involved in battles over other forms of intellectual property \u2014 most notably, in respect of trade marks relating to the United States,145 and China.146 It is striking that the company has not espoused an open source philosophy when it comes to trade mark law.

In China, Tesla Motors encountered a number of troubles in respect of trademark law.152 Professor Eric Lane from Thomas Jefferson School of Law has been following the longstanding conflict, and has provided a useful summary of the dispute: As it sought to expand into the Chinese market, the electric car maker encountered a businessman named Zhan Baosheng who owned registrations for the TESLA (or \u201cTe Si La\u201d transliterated) trademark in China in both English and Chinese. While Zhan\u2019s trademark rights initially blocked Tesla from using the mark there, in early 2014 the company announced that it had resolved the matter though a court decision granting it the right to use the TESLA mark in China.

B. Gigafactory In February 2014, Tesla Motors announced its ambition to establish a Gigafactory: As we at Tesla reach for our goal of producing a mass market electric car in approximately three years, we have an opportunity to leverage our projected demand for lithium ion batteries to reduce their cost faster than previously thought possible. In cooperation with strategic battery manufacturing partners, we\u2019re planning to build a large scale factory that will allow us to achieve economies of scale and minimize costs through innovative manufacturing, reduction of logistics waste, optimization of co-located processes and reduced overhead. The Gigafactory is designed to reduce cell costs much faster than the status quo and, by 2020, produce more lithium ion batteries annually than were produced worldwide in 2013. By the end of the first year of volume production of our mass market vehicle, we expect the Gigafactory will have driven down the per kWh cost of our battery pack by more than 30 percent.180 178 179 180 Ibid.

What we are trying to address is not the lay of the land today, where there are indeed too many suppliers, most of whom are producing relatively low photonic efficiency solar cells at uncompelling costs, but how we see the future developing. Without decisive action to lay the groundwork today, the massive volume of affordable, high efficiency panels needed for unsubsidized solar power to outcompete fossil fuel grid power simply will not be there when it is needed. SolarCity was founded to accelerate mass adoption of sustainable energy. The sun, that highly convenient and free fusion reactor in the sky, radiates more energy to the Earth in a few hours than the entire human population consumes from all sources in a year. This means that solar panels, paired with batteries to enable power at night, can produce several orders of magnitude more electricity than is consumed by the entirety of human civilization. A cogent assessment of sustainable energy potential from various sources is described well in this Sandia paper:www.sandia.gov/~jytsao/Solar%20FAQs.pdf. Even if the solar industry were only to generate 40 percent of the world\u2019s electricity with photovoltaics by 2040, that would mean installing more than 400 GW of solar capacity per year for the next 25 years.

The Lost Treasure of Pi-Rate Island On the edge of the vast, sparkling ocean lay two islands known for their legends and mysteries: Pi-Rate Island and A-Rate Island. Pi-Rate Island, famous for its pirate lore, was said to hold a long-lost treasure. A-Rate Island, just a short sail away, was popular among wanderers for its breathtaking views and hidden caves. In the small coastal village of Seaside, young Finn was known for his adventurous spirit and boundless curiosity. His grandfather, a retired sailor, often regaled him with tales of treasure maps and pirate legends. One day, Finn found an old, weathered map tucked away in a dusty corner of his grandfather's attic. The map had faded markings but clearly showed a route to Pi-Rate Island with a large \u201cX\u201d marking the spot where the treasure was buried. With his heart racing, Finn set off on a small sailboat, the \u201cSea Serpent,\u201d to uncover the secrets of Pi-Rate Island. He packed his essentials, including a compass, a rope, and a trusty spyglass, and set sail on a bright, sunny morning.

Upon arriving at Pi-Rate Island, Finn was greeted by a dense jungle and a maze of rocky cliffs. The island's eerie, fog-covered landscape was both enchanting and foreboding. Finn\u2019s first challenge was to find a way through the tangled jungle. With his map and compass in hand, he ventured deeper into the island. Along the way, Finn encountered a mischievous parrot named Captain Squawk, who had been living on the island for years. Captain Squawk had a colorful plumage and a knack for riddles. \u201cAhoy, young adventurer!\u201d squawked the parrot. \u201cIf ye want to find the treasure, ye must first solve me riddles!\u201d Finn was eager to prove himself. Captain Squawk perched on a branch and recited his first riddle: \u201cI can fly without wings, I can cry without eyes. Wherever I go, darkness flies. What am I?\u201d Finn thought hard, then answered, \u201cA cloud!\u201d The parrot fluttered in approval and revealed a hidden path. As Finn followed the path, he came across an ancient, crumbling pirate fort. The fort was filled with remnants of old battles and dusty relics.

Finn\u2019s next challenge was to find the golden compass, which was rumored to be hidden in the Whispering Caves. The caves were filled with echoes and tricky paths that seemed to shift and change. Finn used his wits and the map to navigate through the caves, avoiding traps and deciphering clues etched into the walls. At the heart of the Whispering Caves, Finn found the golden compass embedded in a stone pedestal. The compass had intricate carvings and glowed faintly. With the compass in hand, Finn felt a surge of excitement. He now needed to crack the secret code mentioned in Blackbeard\u2019s journal. Returning to the pirate fort, Finn studied the journal carefully. The secret code was hidden in a series of symbols that needed to be aligned in a specific order. Finn used the golden compass to guide him, and after several attempts, he managed to decipher the code. The final clue led Finn to a hidden chamber beneath the fort. The chamber was adorned with old treasure chests, but the true treasure was hidden behind a sliding wall. Finn used the code to unlock the wall, revealing a dazzling array of gold coins, jewels, and precious artifacts. At the center of the treasure was a beautifully crafted chest with a plaque that",

The Enchanted Library In the charming village of Willowbrook, there was once a grand library known as the Enchanted Library, famous for its magical books and timeless tales. Sadly, a dark spell had sealed the library for years, leaving its wonders dormant and forgotten.

Each painting depicted scenes from famous stories, but they seemed frozen in time. Emily\u2019s first challenge was to solve a puzzle to unlock a hidden door. The door was adorned with a riddle: \u201cI speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body, but I come alive with wind. What am I?\u201d Barnaby hovered beside her, his pages fluttering with anticipation. Emily thought deeply and answered, \u201cAn echo!\u201d The door creaked open, revealing a hidden chamber filled with old, dusty scrolls. In this chamber, Emily and Barnaby discovered a journal with clues to the library\u2019s secrets. The journal spoke of three enchanted relics that held the key to awakening the magic: a mystical feather, a golden quill, and an ancient scroll. Their journey led them to the Hall of Relics, where the feather was hidden. The room was filled with enchanted traps and magical barriers. Emily had to navigate through a series of moving platforms and shifting walls. With Barnaby\u2019s guidance and encouragement, Emily\u2019s quick thinking and bravery helped her retrieve",

With Barnaby\u2019s guidance and encouragement, Emily\u2019s quick thinking and bravery helped her retrieve the feather. Next, they ventured to the Whispering Woods, a part of the library filled with living trees and magical creatures. The golden quill was hidden in a tree that spoke in riddles. Emily had to answer the tree\u2019s questions correctly to retrieve the quill. Their final quest took them to the Echoing Cavern, where the ancient scroll was hidden. The cavern was filled with echoes that created illusions and distractions. Emily had to use her wits and Barnaby\u2019s wisdom to find the scroll amidst the confusion. As they gathered the relics, Emily and Barnaby returned to the Grand Hall. The heart of the library was a massive, ancient tree with branches covered in shimmering leaves. Each leaf represented a story waiting to be told. The tree\u2019s base held a grand chest locked with a combination that required solving a series of riddles. Emily and Barnaby worked together to solve the riddles: 1. 2. 3. \u201cI am taken from a mine, and shut up in a wooden case, from which I am never released, and yet I am used by almost every person. What am I?\u201d \u201cI can be cracked, made, told, and played. What am I?\u201d \u201cI have keys but open no locks. I have space but no room. You can enter but not go",

When Emily finally opened the chest, a brilliant light burst forth, filling the library with warmth and magic. The once-sleeping books awoke, their pages rustling with excitement, and the enchantment of the library was restored. Emily and Barnaby watched as the library transformed into a vibrant, magical place. The books floated gently from the shelves, and the air was filled with the soft whispers of stories coming to life. Emily was given the special gift of bringing stories to life simply by reading them aloud. Returning to Willowbrook, Emily shared her adventure with the villagers, who marveled at the revived Enchanted Library. The library\u2019s doors were now open to everyone, and the village celebrated the magic of stories and the wonders of imagination. Emily\u2019s adventure taught her that the true magic of the library was not just in its books but in the belief and curiosity that could awaken even the deepest enchantments.

The villagers\u2014an eclectic mix of magical creatures\u2014welcomed her warmly. The first villager Ella met was a jovial elf named Lorian.

The lanterns that usually floated with a soft, warm glow were dim, and the animals that once played in the streets seemed restless.

Ella was introduced to the village\u2019s wise old wizard, Alaric, who had once been a guardian of the Heartstone but had lost his memory and powers after the crystal was stolen. Alaric, though frail and forgetful, gave Ella a magical compass that would guide her to the sorcerer\u2019s lair.

The Brave Little Kitten Once upon a time in a cozy village, there was a tiny kitten named Whiskers who lived with her grandmother, Nana Tilly.

Whiskers faced each challenge with bravery and cleverness. She used her agility to dodge the monkey, her keen senses to navigate the maze, and her charm to convince the dog to return the last piece. When she finally gathered all the pieces, the fortune teller was overjoyed. She carefully reassembled the crystal ball and performed a spell.
