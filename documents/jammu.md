A day after India decided to hold the Indus Water Treaty at abeyance, Pakistan Prime Minister’s Office said any such attempt would be seen as an “act of war”. The country also announced a series of retaliatory actions including blocking its airspace for India and suspension of all trade activities.

Pakistan’s National Security Committee comprising top civilian and military leadership held its meeting chaired by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday (April 24, 2025).

The Committee observed that Kashmir remains an unresolved dispute between Pakistan and India and reiterated its stand that Kashmiris have the right of self-determination. While “unequivocally” condemning the terror attack, the Pakistan’s Prime Minister’s Office stated, “In the absence of any credible investigation and verifiable evidence, attempts to link the Pahalgam attack with Pakistan are frivolous, devoid of rationality and defeat logic.”

The Committee decided to “vehemently reject” the Indian announcement to hold the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance. “The Treaty is a binding international agreement brokered by the World Bank and contains no provision for unilateral suspension. Water is a Vital National Interest of Pakistan, a lifeline for its 240 million people and its availability will be safeguarded at all costs. Any attempt to stop or divert the flow of water belonging to Pakistan as per the Indus Waters Treaty, and the usurpation of the rights of lower riparian will be considered as an Act of War and responded with full force across the complete spectrum of National Power,” a statement read.

In retaliation, Pakistan has decided to keep all bilateral agreements with India, including the Shimla Pact in abeyance. Pakistan shall close down the Wagah Border Post, with immediate effect and all cross-border transit from India through this route shall be suspended, without exception. Those who have crossed with valid endorsements may return through that route immediately but not later than April 30, 2025.

Just like India, Pakistan too has suspended all visas under SAARC Visa Exemption Scheme (SVES) issued to Indian nationals, but gave exception to Sikh pilgrims. It urged Indians in Pakistan to leave within 48 hours.

Declaring the Indian Defence, Naval and Air Advisors in Islamabad as ‘persona non grata’, the country has asked them to leave by April 30, 2025. The strength of Indian High Commission in Islamabad shall be reduced to 30 diplomats and staff members, with effect from April 30, 2025.

Pakistan’s airspace will be closed with immediate effect for all Indian-owned or Indian-operated airlines. All trade with India, including to and from any third country through Pakistan, has also been suspended.

Expressing concern over the loss of tourists’ lives, the Committee reviewed the Indian measures announced on 23 April 2025 and termed them unilateral, unjust, politically motivated, extremely irresponsible and devoid of legal merit

The National Security Committee made the following observations:

Kashmir remains an unresolved dispute between Pakistan and India as recognized through multiple UN resolutions. Pakistan continues to support the right of self-determination of the Kashmiri people. The continued Indian state oppression, abrogation of statehood, political and demographic gerrymandering, has persistently led to an organic backlash from the people of IIOJK, which perpetuates cycles of violence. India’s systemic persecution of minorities, particularly Muslims, has become more pervasive. Attempts at forced passage of Waqf Bill is the latest effort to marginalize Muslims across India. India must resist the temptation to exploit such tragic incidents to its advantage and take full responsibility for its failure to provide security to the people

Pakistan unequivocally condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. As the world’s front-line state against terrorism, Pakistan has suffered immense human and economic losses. Indian attempts to inject volatility in the environment along Pakistan’s Eastern borders is aimed at distracting Pakistan’s counter-terrorism efforts. In the absence of any credible investigation and verifiable evidence, attempts to link the Pahalgam attack with Pakistan are frivolous, devoid of rationality and defeat logic.
